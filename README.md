## 🔄 **Sorting Algorithms Overview**

### 🔸 Bubble Sort

* Repeatedly compares adjacent elements
* Swaps if in wrong order
* Time Complexity: **O(n²)**

### 🔸 Selection Sort

* Selects minimum element
* Places it at the correct position
* Time Complexity: **O(n²)**

### 🔸 Insertion Sort

* Builds sorted array one element at a time
* Good for nearly sorted data
* Time Complexity: **O(n²)**
